/**
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a security model based on user ownership, role-based access
 * control (RBAC), and structural segregation for public data. The primary goal is to
 * ensure that users can only access their own private data, while designated Public
 * Health Inspectors (PHIs) have privileged access to operational data like alerts
 * and private reports. Publicly visible data, such as for the heatmap, is stored
 * in a separate, read-only collection to prevent data leakage.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: A user's private profile document, accessible only by that user.
 * - /roles_phi/{phiId}: A collection where the existence of a document signifies a
 *   user is a PHI. This collection is managed server-side.
 * - /surveillance_reports_private/{reportId}: Contains detailed, sensitive report
 *   information. Access is restricted to the submitting user and read-only for PHIs.
 * - /surveillance_reports_public_map_data/{reportId}: A public, read-only collection
 *   containing non-sensitive data for map visualization. Writes are prohibited from
 *   the client-side to ensure data integrity.
 * - /phi_alerts/{alertId}: Contains operational alerts accessible only by PHIs.
 * - /district_risks/{districtName}: Caches weather-based risk calculations for districts.
 *   Publicly readable but not client-writable.
