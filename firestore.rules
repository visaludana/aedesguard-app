/**
 * This ruleset enforces a security model based on user ownership and a dedicated
 * role-based access control (RBAC) system for Public Health Inspectors (PHIs).
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The security model is designed for high performance and clarity by strictly
 * adhering to two main principles: Authorization Independence and Structural
 * Segregation. Authorization decisions rely on data denormalized directly onto
 * the documents being secured, avoiding slow and costly cross-document `get()`
 * calls in rules.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /userProfiles/{userId}: Private user data, accessible only by the owner.
 * - /roles_phi/{userId}: A dedicated collection to grant PHI privileges. The
 *   existence of a document here signifies a user is a PHI, providing a fast
 *   and atomic role check.
 * - Top-level collections (/surveillanceSamples, /phiAlerts, /neutralizationVerifications):
 *   These collections store shared application data. They are secured using
 *   denormalized ownership fields (e.g., `uploaderId`) and PHI role checks.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - PHI Role Management: A separate `/roles_phi` collection is used to manage
 *   PHI status. This "Existence over Content" pattern is more performant and
 *   secure than checking a role field on a user profile. Client-side writes to
 *   this collection are disabled; it must be managed by a trusted backend process.
 * - Denormalization for Authorization: Ownership fields like `uploaderId` and
 *   `verifierId` are denormalized onto documents in shared collections. This allows
 *   rules to validate ownership directly without extra reads.
 * - User Privacy: Listing all user profiles is explicitly disallowed to protect
 *   user privacy.
 * - Public Data with Secure Writes: The `surveillanceSamples` collection is readable
 *   by any signed-in user to support features like a global heatmap, but write
 *   operations are strictly limited to the document's original creator.
 * - Prototyping Flexibility: These rules focus strictly on authorization (who can
 *   access what) and relational integrity (e.g., `uploaderId` must be correct).
 *   They do not enforce specific data types or shapes, allowing for rapid
 *   application development.
